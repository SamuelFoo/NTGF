NTGF was first developed by Kimbell. This repository tries to implement it in Python to be compatible with our lab's existing Python codes.

NTGF stands for numerical tunnelling green function. It tries to simulate a material structure with stacked 2d planes, connected by a tunnelling parameter.
Users can specify each layer's parameters with attributes inside the layer class, or the global parameter with attributes inside the GlobalParam class.
NTGF will then tries to calculate for the band gap under different situations.
